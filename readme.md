<h1>Hello!</h1>
Food picker is my first React project which helps me understand this library. I create this app for hungry people who currently don't know what they want to eat. It will be an interactive form, which depending on chosen answers will show a meal you probably want to eat, a recipe for it and needed ingredients.
