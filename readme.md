<h1>Hello!</h1>
Meal seeker is my first React project which helped me understand this library. I created this app for people who don't know what they want to eat at the moment. It's an interactive form, which depending on chosen answers chooses and shows a meal you probably want to eat, a recipe for it and needed ingredients.
